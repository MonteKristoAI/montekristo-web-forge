## Form → Airtable Integration

This project includes a secure contact form that integrates with Airtable and optional N8N webhooks.

### Required Environment Variables

The following secrets must be configured in your Supabase project:

- `AIRTABLE_TOKEN` - Your Airtable personal access token
- `AIRTABLE_BASE_ID` - The ID of your Airtable base (e.g., `appVLpqR0DWUB3Ss0`)
- `AIRTABLE_TABLE_ID` - The ID of your form submissions table (e.g., `tblSwgWKCteiWW2KJ`)
- `N8N_WEBHOOK_URL` - Optional N8N webhook URL for additional processing

### Airtable Table Structure

Your Airtable table should have these fields:

- **Name** (Single line text)
- **Work Email** (Email)
- **Company** (Single line text)
- **Bottleneck** (Single select with options):
  - Lead Outreach & Qualification
  - CRM Management & Updates
  - Content Creation & Distribution
  - Sales Process Optimization
  - Other
- **Notes** (Long text)
- **Submitted At** (Date & time)

### Security Features

- **Rate limiting**: 10 requests per minute per IP address
- **Honeypot protection**: Hidden field to detect bots
- **Input validation**: Comprehensive server-side validation
- **CORS protection**: Proper headers for web security
- **Error handling**: Graceful degradation with user-friendly messages

### Testing the Integration

You can test the form submission endpoint directly:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://kulcfydqylhvufevlcra.supabase.co/functions/v1/form-submit" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Ada Lovelace",
    "email": "ada@example.com", 
    "company": "Analytical Engines",
    "bottleneck": "Lead Outreach & Qualification",
    "notes": "Excited to learn more about AI automation.",
    "website": ""
  }'
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "ok": true
}
```

### Edge Function URL

The form submits to: `https://kulcfydqylhvufevlcra.supabase.co/functions/v1/form-submit`

### Running Tests

To run the Edge Function unit tests:

```bash
deno test supabase/functions/form-submit/_tests.ts --allow-env --allow-net
```
